# Dice-Game
##### It's a mini game built with vanilla JS. Built it in initial days of learning JS. Feel free to try it out.
## How game works?
It's a two player game. Player rolls a dice , If player gets anything except 1 , current dice outcome will be added to score  <br>
But if the dice outcome is 1 , player's score will reset to 0 and other player gets the turn <br>
But at the time of turn , a player can decide to hold which wouldn't reset player's score and turn will be passed to other player <br>
First player to score 100 wins
